# Sommerfeld Partial Wave Corrections Calculator

This repository contains code designed to calculate total cross-sections for processes where Sommerfeld corrections are relevant at higher orders, for any angular momentum number, *l*. The code is based on the research papers available on arXiv: [arXiv:1612.02825v4](https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.02825v4) and [arXiv:2203.04326v2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.04326v2).

## Introduction

The primary goal of this project is to develop a tool that can take any Lagrangian input formatted in simple LaTeX style and produce scattering amplitudes with Sommerfeld corrections already applied. The output can be generated in both LaTeX format and as Python functions.

## Features

- Calculate total cross-sections with Sommerfeld corrections for various processes.
- Input any Lagrangian in simple LaTeX format.
- Obtain scattering amplitudes with Sommerfeld corrections in LaTeX and Python function formats.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get started with the Sommerfeld Corrections Calculator:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mardesoushi/xsec-parwaver.py.git
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies if necessary (list them here).

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the code with your desired input Lagrangian. (TO DO)

   ```bash
   python main.py your_input_file.tex
   ```

4. You will find the output scattering amplitudes in LaTeX and Python function formats in the designated output directory.

## Usage (TO DO)

To use this code effectively, follow these guidelines:

1. Prepare your input Lagrangian in a LaTeX file, e.g., `your_input_file.tex`.

2. Run the code as mentioned in the "Getting Started" section, providing your input LaTeX file as an argument.

3. Review the output files in the designated output directory for the calculated scattering amplitudes.
